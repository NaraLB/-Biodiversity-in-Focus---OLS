# What are we doing?
<b>The problem</b>

Brazil is facing a setback in environmental policies and science funding as both are not priorities for the general public and current government. This is a historical issue in Brazil due to complex factors, and one of these factors is the low engagement of scientists with the general public and the low levels of education countrywide. Even when scientists are engaged in science communication (SciComm)and outreach activities, these are predominantly in local scale and based in an information deficit model. This generally occurs because scientists in Brazil do not experience a formal training for SciComm and quite often try to learn after graduate school in a trial and error learning basis.

<b>The solution</b>

@Biodiversity in Focus will set a social media platform where Brazil-based scientistics focused in biodiversity may share their experiences in research and their knowledge about biodiversity. In addition, account curation will be mostly performed by graduate students, which will be able to develop SciComm skills.

# Who are we?

# What do we need?
We would love any feedback along our way to create this platform for SciComm.
The account will be curated by different researchers every week. As we are focused in a Brazilian audience, we need curators that study speak portuguese and are primarily focused on Brazilian biodiversity.

# Get involved
If you can help in any of the above areas or anything we haven't thought, check our contributors' guidelines. We want to keep a safe and positive environment for everyone involved in the project, so we ask you to follow the code of conduct in all offline and online interactions you may have.
